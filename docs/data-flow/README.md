# Data Flow Documentation

This section documents how data flows through the Paddler system, from client requests to model responses.

## Overview

Understanding data flow is crucial for:
- Performance optimization
- Debugging issues
- Capacity planning
- Security analysis

## Documentation Structure

- **[Request Processing](./request-processing.md)** - Complete request lifecycle from client to response
- **[Model Management](./model-management.md)** - How models are loaded, updated, and synchronized
- **[State Synchronization](./state-synchronization.md)** - How system state is maintained across components
- **[Streaming Responses](./streaming-responses.md)** - How real-time token streaming works
- **[Error Propagation](./error-propagation.md)** - How errors flow through the system

## Key Flow Patterns

### Synchronous Flows
- Health checks
- Configuration updates
- Status queries

### Asynchronous Flows
- Inference requests
- Model loading
- State reconciliation

### Streaming Flows
- Token generation
- Real-time monitoring
- Log streaming
