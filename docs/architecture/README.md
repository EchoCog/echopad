# Architecture Documentation

This section provides comprehensive architectural documentation for Paddler, covering system design, component relationships, and architectural patterns.

## Overview

Paddler implements a distributed LLMOps architecture with clear separation between coordination and inference responsibilities:

- **Balancer**: Central coordinator for request distribution, model management, and system monitoring
- **Agents**: Distributed inference workers that handle actual LLM processing using llama.cpp
- **Web Admin Panel**: Management interface for configuration and monitoring

## Architecture Documents

### Core Architecture
- **[System Overview](./system-overview.md)** - High-level system architecture and design principles
- **[Core Components](./core-components.md)** - Detailed breakdown of major system components
- **[Component Relationships](./component-relationships.md)** - How components interact and depend on each other

### Specialized Architectures
- **[Inference Architecture](./inference-architecture.md)** - How LLM inference is structured and managed
- **[State Management](./state-management.md)** - Distributed state synchronization and consistency
- **[Communication Patterns](./communication-patterns.md)** - Inter-component communication protocols

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between orchestration (Balancer) and execution (Agents)
2. **Horizontal Scalability**: Agents can be dynamically added/removed for scaling
3. **Fault Tolerance**: System continues operating when individual agents fail
4. **Zero-Downtime Scaling**: Request buffering enables scaling from zero hosts
5. **Model Flexibility**: Dynamic model swapping without system restart
